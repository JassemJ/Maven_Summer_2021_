Hey All, we came a long way. Now it’s time to be serious and stay motivated to land your dream job.

Action Item:
Take express action item and convert it to page object model framework. Using new reusable methods and annotation class. Update the reusable methods that I didn’t modify by adding logger, screenshot and changing xpath string to WebElement. Once you have completed the project just commit and push it to github and send screenshot of html report.

Best of luck and make the final assignment count :)
